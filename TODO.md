# Todo

1. Let users change the keybinds to start/stop the macro
2. Let the users save config profiles and simply change between them
3. After the macro is stopped, have it send a final report, which is like the hourly report, but using info from the start to finish of the macro
4. Add a goo toggle (uses goo settings from existing settings), so it uses goo when collecting from that field
